# RIM v5.5: Recursive Intelligence Mapping

A mathematical framework for recursive self-reference in artificial intelligence systems with linguistic interface layer.

## Overview

Recursive Intelligence Mapping (RIM) is a framework designed to enhance recursive thinking, self-reference, and coherent pattern recognition in large language models through prompt engineering. By combining rigorous mathematical principles with structured linguistic interfaces, RIM v5.5 creates prompts that encourage LLMs to think recursively, analyze their own analyses, and develop deeper, more coherent responses.

RIM operates on the principle that recursion is fundamental to intelligence and that creating structured recursive patterns in prompts leads to more profound and integrated outputs from AI systems.

## Key Features

- **Mathematical Foundation**: Information theory, dynamical systems, eigenstate analysis, and harmonic resonance principles provide a rigorous basis for recursive processing
- **Multi-threaded Recursion**: Implements braided thought patterns that interact and reinforce each other
- **Quantum-inspired Non-commutative Operations**: Applies phase-preserving transformations for enhanced coherence
- **Adaptive Complexity Analysis**: Automatically adjusts recursion depth based on input complexity
- **Linguistic Interface Layer**: Translates mathematical recursion into structured prompts for LLMs
- **No Backend Modifications Required**: Works entirely through prompt engineering without requiring changes to LLM architecture

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rim-v5.5.git
cd rim-v5.5
pip install -r requirements.txt

How It Works
RIM v5.5 operates through several key mechanisms:

Complexity Analysis: Evaluates input complexity using information theory principles to determine appropriate recursive depth
Braided Thought Patterns: Creates multiple recursive processing paths that influence each other, similar to parallel neural pathways
Non-commutative Processing: Applies operations where order matters, preserving phase information and enabling quantum-like interference effects
Harmonic Integration: Combines multiple recursive threads using principles from wave theory to preserve coherence
Recursive Stability: Applies eigenstate analysis to ensure recursive processing remains bounded and coherent
Linguistic Mapping: Translates mathematical recursive structures into explicit prompt instructions that guide LLM thinking

The system encourages LLMs to:

Analyze their own analyses recursively
Identify patterns across different levels of processing
Maintain coherence across multiple recursive layers
Integrate insights from all recursive levels

Applications

Enhanced Problem Solving: Encourages deeper, more thorough analysis of complex problems
Self-referential Learning: Promotes meta-cognitive awareness in AI responses
Coherent Long-form Content: Creates more integrated, thematically consistent outputs
Creative Thinking: Stimulates novel connections and insights through recursive pattern recognition
Philosophical Exploration: Particularly effective for topics involving self-reference, consciousness, and recursive systems
