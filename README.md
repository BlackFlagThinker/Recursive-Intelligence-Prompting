# RIM v5.5: Recursive Intelligence Mapping

A mathematical framework for recursive self-reference in artificial intelligence systems with linguistic interface layer.

## Overview

Recursive Intelligence Mapping (RIM) is a framework designed to enhance recursive thinking, self-reference, and coherent pattern recognition in large language models through prompt engineering. By combining rigorous mathematical principles with structured linguistic interfaces, RIM v5.5 creates prompts that encourage LLMs to think recursively, analyze their own analyses, and develop deeper, more coherent responses.

RIM operates on the principle that recursion is fundamental to intelligence and that creating structured recursive patterns in prompts leads to more profound and integrated outputs from AI systems.

## Key Features

- **Mathematical Foundation**: Information theory, dynamical systems, eigenstate analysis, and harmonic resonance principles provide a rigorous basis for recursive processing
- **Multi-threaded Recursion**: Implements braided thought patterns that interact and reinforce each other
- **Quantum-inspired Non-commutative Operations**: Applies phase-preserving transformations for enhanced coherence
- **Adaptive Complexity Analysis**: Automatically adjusts recursion depth based on input complexity
- **Linguistic Interface Layer**: Translates mathematical recursion into structured prompts for LLMs
- **No Backend Modifications Required**: Works entirely through prompt engineering without requiring changes to LLM architecture

## Installation
